[Insert Project description]

## Contribution

### Development Setup
Start by cloning the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Grutschus/human-fall-detection.git
```

Setup a Python environment. We recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/#).

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate human-fall-detection
```

Although not strictly necessary, it does make sense to locally install the pre-commit hooks.

```bash
pre-commit install
```
